# Release and versioning

Branching, semver policy, the PR-creation procedure, and the release pipeline.

## Branching

Long-lived branches:

- `main` — integration trunk. Default branch on GitHub. PRs target here. (As of milestone [#13](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/milestone/13), merges to `main` no longer auto-publish — releases fire from `release/vN` branches instead. See the release pipeline section below.)
- `release/v11` and later — release channel per **major** version. Tag-triggered releases fire from here. Protected per the policy below. See [RFC #267](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/267) for the full model.
- `release/v10.1`, `release/v10.2`, `release/v10.3` — per-**minor** maintenance lines for the pre-v11 (NUKE-lineage) versions. These cover the versions consumers are running today, so each one is patched independently (`10.2.x`, `10.3.x`, …) without dragging in later minors. The split is per-minor only for the 10.x series; v11 onward is per-major. Each branch sits at the **tip** of its version line as shipped:
  - `release/v10.1` → fork-from-NUKE line (NUKE `10.1.0` lineage, before independent versioning).
  - `release/v10.2` → the `10.2.x` line (first independent Nerdbank versioning).
  - `release/v10.3` → the `10.3.x` line (where the first `!` breaking changes — the System.Text.Json migration — actually landed).

Short-lived branches (opened as PRs against `main`, then squash- or rebase-merged):

- `feature/<slug>`, `bugfix/<slug>`, `chore/<slug>`, `docs/<slug>`, `pr/<num>-<slug>`.

No `develop`, `master`, or `hotfix/*` branches. The trunk is `main`: new work integrates there and flows out to `release/v11`+. The `release/v10.x` lines are maintenance-only — fixes for a still-supported 10.x minor land via a PR targeting (or a cherry-pick to) the relevant `release/v10.x` branch and are tagged from there. Fixes that also apply to the current major land on `main` first via a normal PR, then are cherry-picked to the relevant `release/vN` and tagged.

CI providers in use: **GitHub Actions only** (others were dropped — see [#8](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/8) for the demand-driven revival roadmap).

### Branch protection on `release/vN`

When a `release/vN` branch is cut, it gets the same protection profile as `main`:

- Required status check: `ubuntu-latest`
- Linear history required (no merge commits)
- CODEOWNER review required
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits land
- Direct pushes blocked (PRs only)
- Force-push and branch deletion blocked
- Conversation resolution required
- Admins not enforced (admins can bypass in emergencies)

Apply by mirroring `main`'s protection JSON to the new branch via the GitHub API (or via repo Settings → Branches). Tag protection for `v*` tags (restricting who can fire a release tag) is tracked separately under milestone #13.

**Validation workflows.** `ubuntu-latest` runs on every PR targeting `main` (with `paths-ignore` for `docs/**`, `.assets/**`, `**/*.md`). `windows-latest` and `macos-latest` run only on push to `main` — they're post-merge / release validation, not PR gates. This is a deliberate cost trade-off.

**Merging.** Both squash and rebase merge are enabled (plain merge commits are disabled by repo setting and would fail linear-history protection anyway). Squash is the default; rebase is opt-in for curated commit sequences. See [CONTRIBUTING.md → Merging](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#merging) for the convention.

## Versioning

[Nerdbank.GitVersioning](https://github.com/dotnet/Nerdbank.GitVersioning) — configured in `version.json` at the repo root. Major+minor is hand-bumped; patch comes from git-height. `main` is the public-release ref (stable versions); everything else gets prerelease tags. GitVersion is still installed as a transitional helper for `MajorMinorPatchVersion` in `Build.cs`; full removal is a follow-up.

## Semver policy

This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) per [CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md). **Any breaking change must bump the major in `version.json` in the same PR before it can merge to `main`.** A "breaking change" is any of:

- A conventional-commit subject with the `!` suffix (e.g. `feat(globaltool)!: …`, `fix(security)!: …`).
- A `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer in the commit body.
- A change a reviewer reasonably flags as breaking even without the marker (renamed/removed public API, package ID change, on-disk format change, CI/CD shape change consumers depend on).

Patch increments from git-height are reserved for non-breaking fixes; carrying breaking changes under a patch series ships them to consumers silently.

**Reviewer responsibility:** if a PR carries `!` (or a flagged breaking change) and `version.json`'s major is unchanged, block the merge until the bump is in the same PR. Record the breaking change under `[Unreleased] — <next-major>` in `CHANGELOG.md` as part of the PR.

## Milestones and version targeting

Milestones are **theme-based** (e.g. "Plugin Architecture Foundation & Rebrand Completion", "Public Plugin SDK", "Continuous Delivery Vision") and carry across releases; version targeting uses **`target/vN`** labels (`target/v11`, `target/v12`, `target/v13`). A breaking change forces a new major via the semver policy above — so its PR carries `target/v<next-major>` instead of `target/v<current-major>`.

## PR-creation flow

At PR-creation time — not after, not as a follow-up — every PR gets:

1. **A `target/vN` label** matching where it will release. Default to `target/v<current-major>` (read `version.json`'s `version` field). If the PR bumps the major (i.e. it carries a breaking change), use `target/v<new-major>` instead. Pass via `--label target/v11` to `gh pr create`.

If the PR includes a **breaking change** (any commit uses `!`, has a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer, or otherwise meets the breaking-change definition above), additionally:

2. **Add the `breaking-change` label.** `gh pr create --label target/v<new-major> --label breaking-change …`.
3. **Open the PR body with a `⚠️ Breaking change` callout** that names the affected surface (public API, package ID, CLI flag, on-disk format, CI/CD shape, etc.) and the consumer-side impact in one sentence. This is what reviewers and downstream consumers read first.
4. **Confirm `version.json`'s major is already bumped** for the target release. If it isn't, stop — bump it in the same branch before opening the PR. Don't open a breaking-change PR against an unchanged-major `version.json`.
5. **Add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry** under the existing `[Unreleased] — <next-major>` heading, in the same PR, describing the breaking change and the migration path (one paragraph minimum).

If you only discover the breaking nature mid-review, apply all relevant steps before requesting re-review.

## Release pipeline

`.github/workflows/release.yml` is **tag-triggered**: pushing a `v*` tag on a `release/v*` branch fires the pipeline. The workflow validates the tag is reachable from a `release/v*` branch, then fans out a Test+Pack job to three parallel publish jobs:

| Job | Environment | Fires on tag push? | What ships | Gating |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `publish-nuget-org` | `nuget-org` | **No — opt-in only** via `workflow_dispatch` flag | `Fallout.*.nupkg` to https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json | Workflow flag + approval-gated env |
| `publish-github-packages` | `github-packages` | Yes | **All** `*.nupkg` (Fallout.* + Nuke.*) to https://nuget.pkg.github.com/ChrisonSimtian/index.json | None |
| `publish-github-releases` | `github-releases` | Yes | All `*.nupkg` attached to a GitHub Release on the tag, auto-generated notes | None |

### Why nuget.org is opt-in for v11

For v11, **GitHub Packages is the de-facto release channel.** nuget.org is reserved for v10.x maintenance lines and a future "stabilised" v11. To publish Fallout.* to nuget.org you must run `workflow_dispatch` with `publish-to-nugetorg=true` — a conscious "this release is ready for nuget.org" switch. Tag pushes alone publish to GitHub Packages + GitHub Releases only.

Two layers of protection on the nuget.org path: the input flag opt-in, plus the `nuget-org` environment's required-reviewer rule.

### Nuke.* shims

`Nuke.*` transition-shim package IDs are owned by the original NUKE maintainer on nuget.org (see [#47](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/47)) — they're permanently routed to GitHub Packages, never nuget.org, regardless of the input flag.

### Re-runs

Each `dotnet nuget push` uses `--skip-duplicate`, so re-runs of a partial publish (one channel failed transiently) are idempotent on packages that already succeeded.

### Tag protection

`v*` tags are protected via a repository ruleset (rules: creation, deletion, update). Bypass actors: repo admins only. Combined with the workflow-dispatch flag and env approval, the nuget.org path has *three* layers (tag-creation + flag opt-in + env approval).

### `workflow_dispatch` inputs

- `tag` (required) — existing tag to (re-)release.
- `publish-to-nugetorg` (boolean, default `false`) — opt into the nuget.org publish job for this run.

Common use cases: re-running a transient-failed publish (`tag` only), or shipping a stabilised release to nuget.org (`tag` + `publish-to-nugetorg=true`).

### Channel philosophy

Per [RFC #267](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/267): nuget.org = production-grade & slow; GitHub Packages = faster cadence (currently the v11 release channel); GitHub Releases = bundled artifacts. A planned Tier 3 (Docker-based local NuGet server for pre-merge testing) shipped via [#279](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/279) — see `tests/integration/docker-compose.yml`.

`NUGET_API_KEY` is scoped to the `nuget-org` GitHub Environment (per [#273](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/273)) — only resolves in the gated job. Prefix reservation tracked in [#33](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/33).

## Adding a new `Fallout.X` package — first-publish gotcha

nuget.org's `Fallout.*` prefix reservation is per-ID, not per-prefix-wildcard: CI's first `nuget push` for any never-published `Fallout.X` package ID returns `403 (does not have permission to access the specified package)` until someone manually web-uploads one nupkg to register the ID. **Two traps when doing that upload:**

1. **Set the package owner to the org, not your personal account.** The nuget.org upload UI doesn't prompt you; ownership defaults to the uploading user's profile. If you forget, the package ID is reserved but the org's `NUGET_API_KEY` still 403s on subsequent pushes (the key is scoped to org-owned packages). Fix via `Manage Package → Owners → Add owner → <org>` then optionally remove your personal account. Or upload using credentials of the org's service account directly. See [#208](https://github.com/ChrisonSimtian/Fallout/issues/208) for what this looks like when it goes wrong.
2. **Validation can lag** the upload by 5–30 minutes. The package page may say "approved" while the API key permission hasn't propagated yet. Wait, then rerun the release pipeline (`gh run rerun <id> --failed`); `--skip-duplicate` makes the retry safe for already-published packages.
